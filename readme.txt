***** Questions for TA's: *********

For create Index:
- for title index, is it okay to just store <id, title string> on each line for each page?

- is it okay to completely parse/read in the entire collection and then create the index, rather than do it all at once?

- why do you say we should concatenate the title with the text?

queryIndex:
- It looks like the boolean parser is only meant for python 2.5 and python 2.6, what if we're using a version of python 3?
