My team-mate bailed out on me, so I did this project alone.


***** Questions for TA's: *********

For create Index:
- for title index, is it okay to just store <id, title string> on each line for each page?

- what to do with something like 'banana++banana'?  should this be 'banana banana' or 'bananabanana'?

queryIndex:
- can we assume BQ's well crafted where none of the words are stopwords?  Like can we assume we'll never encounter 'is AND forever'?



TODO: *********************************************

- replace reconstruct_Index parser with more efficient method for reconstructing index
